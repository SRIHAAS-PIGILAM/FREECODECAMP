"""A RegEx, or Regular Expression, is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern.

RegEx can be used to check if a string contains the specified search pattern.

RegEx Module:
Python has a built-in package called re, which can be used to work with Regular Expressions.

Import the re module:
import re

"""

import re

#Check if the string starts with "The" and ends with "Spain":

txt = "The rain in Spain"
x = re.search("^The.*Spain$", txt)

if x:
  print("YES! We have a match!")
else:
  print("No match")


"""RegEx Functions:
The re module offers a set of functions that allows us to search a string for a match:

Function	Description
findall	    Returns a list containing all matches
search	    Returns a Match object if there is a match anywhere in the string
split	    Returns a list where the string has been split at each match
sub	        Replaces one or many matches with a string
