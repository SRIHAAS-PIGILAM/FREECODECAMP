The code splits a sentence into words using the 
split()
 method and assigns the resulting list to the variable 
pieces
.

It then splits the fourth word in the list, which is 
pieces[3]
, into two parts using the 
-
 symbol as the separator and assigns the resulting list to the variable 
parts
.

Finally, the code checks if the second part of the split (
parts[1]
) is present in the original sentence and returns a Boolean value (
True
 if it is present, 
False
 otherwise).
